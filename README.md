# ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

This project is **currently in development** and aims to leverage **Machine Learning (ML)** for **breast cancer detection**. By analyzing medical data, the model will predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign, supporting early diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing real-world breast cancer datasets for training.
- **Model Implementation**: Developing and fine-tuning ML algorithms to optimize accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Validating model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies:
- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): Programming language for data manipulation and ML development.
- [**Scikit-learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/): For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data analysis and preprocessing.
- [**NumPy**](https://numpy.org/): For numerical computing and array operations.
- [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/): For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- [**Seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): For data visualization based on Matplotlib.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals:
- Explore how machine learning can aid in **early detection** of breast cancer.
- Compare various ML models to determine the most effective approach.
- Provide insights into the data that can guide future improvements in healthcare.

## ðŸš§ Current Status:
This project is actively being developed, and contributions or suggestions are welcome!
